## About Inventory & Tasks Manager Project

This project is a comprehensive Task and Inventory Management System designed to streamline the operations of small to medium-sized businesses. Built using the Laravel framework, the system offers a robust, scalable, and secure platform that simplifies the management of tasks, team collaboration, and inventory tracking.

## Key Features:

- Task Management: Users can create, assign, and track tasks across different projects. Each task can have a deadline, priority level, and status updates to ensure timely completion.
- Team Collaboration: The system allows team members to collaborate, share updates, and view progress on assigned tasks.
- Inventory Management: Keep track of stock levels, item categories, suppliers, and inventory movements. Automated low-stock alerts help prevent shortages.
- Real-time Analytics: Generate reports on task completion rates and inventory levels to optimize productivity and resource allocation.
- User Roles & Permissions: Role-based access control ensures that only authorized users can perform critical actions like editing inventory data or assigning high-priority tasks.
- Notifications & Alerts: Receive email or SMS notifications for task deadlines, stock shortages, and other critical updates.
- Responsive Design: The system is mobile-friendly, allowing users to access and manage tasks and inventory on the go.
